# image_to_story

## VisionTale : Where every picture tells a story.

* Turn any image into an engaging story and hear it come to life! </br>
* VisionTale allows you to upload an image, and it will generate a short story based on the image's content using image captioning. The generated story is then converted to audio using text-to-speech technology.  </br>
* You can both see the generated story and listen to it and download it. </br>
* This project uses LangChain, Hugging Face models, and Google Colab to generate a caption from an image, transform that into a creative story, and convert it into natural-sounding speech.
